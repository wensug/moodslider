# moodslider
Project that recommends movies based on your mood

There is no doubt that content is one of the most important things to Sky. As a result how
content is made available and recommended to customers needs careful consideration
and Sky is always looking for innovating ways of doing this.
The Sky Marketing team have asked Software Engineering to create a recommendations
application which will enable customers to view content Sky has offer based on their
mood. We have called this application ‘Moodslider’
Your task is to create a web application that will display content based on what customers
tell us they are in the mood for. Once they have made their selections, the application
should recommend some content and display it on the page. In addition you will need to
provide a feature that will enable content data to be uploaded. Your application should
also be Sky branded.
